# SentinelX

## What This Is

A universal threat intelligence hub for SOC analysts. Paste free-form text (alerts, email headers, threat reports, raw IOCs) and the app extracts, normalizes, classifies, and enriches IOCs against 15 providers in parallel — presenting unified summary verdicts with expandable per-provider detail rows, bookmarkable per-IOC detail pages with relationship graphs, and analyst annotations (notes + tags). Analyses are persisted to SQLite and reloadable from the home page. No opaque combined scores.

## Core Value

Safe, correct, and transparent IOC extraction and enrichment — never invent scores, never make network calls the analyst didn't ask for, never trust input or API responses.

## Current State

**M008 complete (2026-03-28).** 1075 tests passing. Monolithic routes.py (488 LOC) decomposed into 8-file app/routes/ package. REST API added: POST /api/analyze for programmatic IOC submission, GET /api/status/<job_id> for enrichment polling. CSRF-exempt, rate-limited. R035 (REST API) validated.

## Architecture / Key Patterns

- **Backend:** Python 3.10 + Flask 3.1, iocextract + iocsearcher for extraction, requests + dnspython for HTTP/DNS
- **Frontend:** TypeScript 5.8 + esbuild (IIFE output), Tailwind CSS standalone CLI, Inter Variable + JetBrains Mono Variable, dark-first zinc design tokens with verdict-only color accents
- **Modules:** 13 TypeScript modules (main.ts + 10 modules/ + 2 types/ + 1 utils/)
- **Enrichment:** 15 providers (12 HTTP via requests.Session, 2 DNS via dnspython, 1 WHOIS via python-whois), per-provider semaphore concurrency, 429-aware backoff, polling cursor
- **Persistence:** SQLite WAL-mode stores (CacheStore for enrichment cache, HistoryStore for analysis history) at ~/.sentinelx/
- **Security:** CSP (7 directives), CSRF, SSRF allowlist, host validation, textContent-only DOM (SEC-08)
- **Build:** Makefile targets — `css`, `js`, `js-dev`, `js-watch`, `typecheck`, `build`
- **Tests:** 1075 total (unit + E2E via Playwright with route-mocking)
