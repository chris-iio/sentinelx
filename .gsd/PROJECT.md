# SentinelX

## What This Is

A universal threat intelligence hub for SOC analysts. Paste free-form text (alerts, email headers, threat reports, raw IOCs) and the app extracts, normalizes, classifies, and enriches IOCs against 15 providers in parallel — presenting unified summary verdicts with expandable per-provider detail rows, bookmarkable per-IOC detail pages with relationship graphs, and analyst annotations (notes + tags). Analyses are persisted to SQLite and reloadable from the home page. No opaque combined scores.

## Core Value

Safe, correct, and transparent IOC extraction and enrichment — never invent scores, never make network calls the analyst didn't ask for, never trust input or API responses.

## Current State

**M006 complete (2026-03-25).** 1043 tests passing. Analysis history persisted to SQLite via HistoryStore — recent analyses list on home page, full results reloadable from /history/<id> via JS replay. WhoisAdapter added as 15th provider (python-whois, port 43, no API key). URL IOC detail links fixed (/detail/ → /ioc/), 8 E2E Playwright tests added. Input page fully tokenized — flex layout fixed, all hardcoded colors/timings replaced with design tokens.

## Architecture / Key Patterns

- **Backend:** Python 3.10 + Flask 3.1, iocextract + iocsearcher for extraction, requests + dnspython for HTTP/DNS
- **Frontend:** TypeScript 5.8 + esbuild (IIFE output), Tailwind CSS standalone CLI, Inter Variable + JetBrains Mono Variable, dark-first zinc design tokens with verdict-only color accents
- **Modules:** 13 TypeScript modules (main.ts + 10 modules/ + 2 types/ + 1 utils/)
- **Enrichment:** 15 providers (12 HTTP via requests.Session, 2 DNS via dnspython, 1 WHOIS via python-whois), per-provider semaphore concurrency, 429-aware backoff, polling cursor
- **Persistence:** SQLite WAL-mode stores (CacheStore for enrichment cache, HistoryStore for analysis history) at ~/.sentinelx/
- **Security:** CSP (7 directives), CSRF, SSRF allowlist, host validation, textContent-only DOM (SEC-08)
- **Build:** Makefile targets — `css`, `js`, `js-dev`, `js-watch`, `typecheck`, `build`
- **Tests:** 1043 total (unit + E2E via Playwright with route-mocking)

## Milestone Sequence

- [x] M001: v1.1 Results Page Redesign — Uniform IOC card architecture, verdict badge prominence, micro-bar, category labels, three-section grouping, inline context line, cache staleness badge
- [x] M002: v1.2 Results Page Rework — Information-first redesign: single-column layout, quiet precision design, at-a-glance enrichment surface, inline expand/collapse, full integration + security audit, E2E suite 91→99 tests
- [x] M003: System Efficiency & Completeness — Per-provider concurrency, 429 backoff, email IOC extraction, detail page redesign, debounced summary rows
- [x] M004: Refactor & Optimize — Concurrency fixes, polling cursor, persistent Sessions, ipinfo.io HTTPS, CacheStore WAL, frontend O(N²) fixes, shared test helpers, CSP expansion
- [x] M005: Codebase Hygiene — safe_request() consolidation across 12 adapters, registry caching at startup, analyze() decomposition into 3 helpers. Net -134 LOC, 960 tests, 0 failures.
- [x] M006: Analyst Workflow & Coverage — Analysis history persistence, WHOIS domain enrichment (15th provider), URL IOC end-to-end polish, input page redesign. 1043 tests, 0 failures.
- [ ] M007: Dead Code & Boilerplate Reduction — safe_request() consolidation (S01 ✅), adapter docstring trimming & dead CSS (S02 ✅), test DRY-up (S03 pending).
