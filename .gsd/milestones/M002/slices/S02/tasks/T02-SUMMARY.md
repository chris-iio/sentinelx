# T02: Build verification and integration test suite

**Applied T01's missing CSS fixes (opacity override, context-line padding, micro-bar width) and verified full build pipeline passes with 36 E2E tests.**

## What Happened

Discovered that T01's git commit (`a695b48`) only committed `.gsd` documentation files — the actual CSS changes to `app/static/src/input.css` were never written to disk. The commit message referenced `app/static/src/input.css` in the description but `git show a695b48 --stat` showed only 4 `.gsd` files changed.

Applied all three CSS fixes from the T01 plan directly in this task:

1. **Opacity override**: Added `opacity: 0.85` to `.enrichment-slot` base rule (pre-load dimmed state) and `.enrichment-slot.enrichment-slot--loaded { opacity: 1; transition: opacity 0.2s ease; }` as the loaded override.

2. **Context-line padding**: Changed `.ioc-context-line` padding from `0.125rem 1rem 0.25rem` to `0.125rem 0 0.25rem` — removes the 1rem left indent that created double-padding with `.ioc-card`'s own horizontal padding.

3. **Micro-bar width**: Changed `.verdict-micro-bar` from `min-width: 4rem` (no max) to `min-width: 5rem; max-width: 8rem` for better visual presence in single-column layout.

Build tools (`tailwindcss`, `esbuild`) were freshly installed via `make tailwind-install && make esbuild-install` before the build run.

## Verification

All must-haves confirmed:

- `make css` → exit 0 (Tailwind compiled `input.css` → `dist/style.css` in 515ms)
- `make typecheck` → exit 0 (zero TS errors)
- `make js-dev` → exit 0 (194.9kb bundle at `dist/main.js`)
- `pytest tests/e2e/test_results_page.py tests/e2e/test_extraction.py -q` → **36 passed in 6.79s**
- `grep -n 'enrichment-slot--loaded' app/static/src/input.css` → lines 1132 (opacity:1 rule) and 1327 (chevron-toggle rule) ✓
- `grep -n 'opacity: 0.85' app/static/src/input.css` → line 1128 (base .enrichment-slot rule) ✓
- Bright hex color scan: no raw hex values adjacent to context-line/summary-row/micro-bar/staleness selectors ✓

## Verification Evidence

| Gate Check | Command | Exit Code | Verdict | Duration |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CSS build | `make css` | 0 | ✅ PASS | 515ms |
| TypeScript check | `make typecheck` | 0 | ✅ PASS | ~15s |
| JS bundle | `make js-dev` | 0 | ✅ PASS (194.9kb) | 12ms |
| E2E tests | `pytest tests/e2e/test_results_page.py tests/e2e/test_extraction.py -q` | 0 | ✅ PASS (36/36) | 6.79s |
| Opacity override present | `grep -n 'enrichment-slot--loaded' input.css` | 0 | ✅ PASS (lines 1132, 1327) | <1s |
| Base opacity preserved | `grep -n 'opacity: 0.85' input.css` | 0 | ✅ PASS (line 1128) | <1s |
| No bright hex colors | Manual scan of enrichment surface CSS rules | N/A | ✅ PASS (design tokens only) | <1s |

## Diagnostics

If enrichment content appears dimmed after enrichment completes:
1. `grep -n 'enrichment-slot--loaded' app/static/src/input.css` — confirm opacity:1 rule is present (line ~1132)
2. In browser devtools: `document.querySelectorAll('.enrichment-slot--loaded').length` — should be > 0 after enrichment; if 0, the TS pipeline (enrichment.ts) failed to add the class, not a CSS issue
3. Check computed opacity on `.enrichment-slot` element — should be 1.0 for loaded slots, 0.85 for loading/empty slots

## Slice-Level Verification (S02)

All slice verification checks pass:
- ✅ `make css` exits 0
- ✅ `make typecheck` exits 0
- ✅ `make js-dev` exits 0
- ✅ `pytest tests/e2e/test_results_page.py tests/e2e/test_extraction.py -q` → 36 passed
- ✅ `grep -n 'opacity: 0.85' app/static/src/input.css` → line 1128, only in `.enrichment-slot` base rule
- ✅ `.enrichment-slot.enrichment-slot--loaded` rule exists with `opacity: 1` at line 1132
- ✅ No bright non-verdict colors in enrichment surface CSS

## Deviations

**Significant deviation:** T01's CSS changes were not present in the working tree — only the `.gsd` documentation was committed. Applied all three CSS fixes here as part of T02 verification. The T01 summary accurately described what _should_ have been done; the implementation just never landed in the file.

## Files Created/Modified

- `app/static/src/input.css` — Added opacity:0.85/1 for enrichment-slot base/loaded states; fixed ioc-context-line padding (1rem → 0); updated verdict-micro-bar min/max-width
- `app/static/dist/style.css` — Rebuilt CSS artifact (Tailwind output)
- `app/static/dist/main.js` — Rebuilt JS bundle (esbuild output)
- `.gsd/milestones/M002/slices/S02/tasks/T02-PLAN.md` — Added Observability Impact section (pre-flight fix)
