<current_state>
v1.2 milestone is at 50% — Phases 11 and 12 are fully complete and verified. Phase 13 (Results Page Redesign) has not been researched or planned yet. This session performed a dead code cleanup (refactor-clean) after Phase 12 wrapped — no phase work was in flight.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Phase 11: Foundation — Design Tokens & Base CSS (3/3 plans) — COMPLETE
  - 11-01: Font infrastructure (Inter Variable + JetBrains Mono self-hosted)
  - 11-02: zinc/emerald/teal design token system with verdict triples
  - 11-03: WCAG AA contrast verification (all 16 pairs passed)
- Phase 12: Shared Component Elevation (3/3 plans) — COMPLETE
  - 12-01: Verdict badge borders, global :focus-visible, ghost button variant
  - 12-02: .form-input dark-theme, frosted-glass filter bar
  - 12-03: Heroicons Jinja2 macro, header/footer redesign with emerald brand accent
- Dead code cleanup (this session):
  - Removed 8 unused test imports, TestConfig class, .btn-ghost CSS, uninstalled pycryptodome
  - Report at .reports/dead-code-analysis.md
  - 224/224 tests passing
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Phase 13: Results Page Redesign — NOT STARTED
  - Requirements: RESULTS-01 through RESULTS-08
  - Key deliverables: Jinja2 template partials extraction, card hover elevation, dot type indicators, shimmer skeleton loader, KPI dashboard, empty state, search icon
  - Success criteria in ROADMAP.md Phase 13 section
  - Needs: /gsd:plan-phase 13
- Phase 14: Input & Settings Page Redesign — NOT STARTED
  - Requirements: PAGE-01 through PAGE-06
  - Depends on Phase 13
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Design system is zinc-950/900/800/700 surfaces, emerald-500 primary, teal-500 focus/interactive
- Verdict badges use tinted-bg + colored-border + colored-text pattern (not solid colors)
- Heroicons v2 inline SVG via Jinja2 macros (no CDN, enables CSS currentColor)
- Inter Variable for UI chrome, JetBrains Mono Variable for IOC values
- Self-hosted fonts in app/static/fonts/
- CSS architecture: :root tokens -> @layer components with BEM -> Jinja2 template partials
- .btn-ghost was removed as dead code (never used in templates) — if Phase 13/14 needs it, re-add from git history
- CAUTION items from dead code analysis (missing settings CSS classes, missing alert-success/warning styles) are design gaps to address in Phase 14
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- None. Clean state, all tests passing, no WIP code.
</blockers>

<context>
v1.2 is a frontend-only milestone (zero backend changes). Phases 11-12 established the design system foundation and shared components. Phases 13-14 apply the design to specific pages. Phase 13 is the most complex remaining phase (8 requirements, template partial extraction + multiple visual features). The codebase is very clean — 224 tests, 97% coverage, no dead code after today's cleanup.
</context>

<next_action>
Start with: /gsd:plan-phase 13 to research and plan the Results Page Redesign. The ROADMAP.md has full success criteria. Key risk: template partial extraction (RESULTS-01) must preserve all E2E tests before any visual changes.
