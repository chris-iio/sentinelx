Phase 12 (Shared Component Elevation) is COMPLETE. All 3 plans executed, all 7 COMP requirements delivered, verification passed with human visual approval. v1.2 milestone is 50% complete (Phases 11 + 12 done, Phases 13 + 14 remain).

Next action is to plan Phase 13 (Results Page Transformation).
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Plan 12-01: Core CSS — verdict badge borders unified (COMP-01), global :focus-visible (COMP-02), ghost button variant (COMP-03) — Done
- Plan 12-02: Form elements — .form-input dark-theme class (COMP-04), frosted-glass filter bar (COMP-05) — Done
- Plan 12-03: Templates — Heroicons Jinja2 macro (COMP-06), header/footer redesign with emerald brand accent (COMP-07) — Done
- Phase verification: Passed (automated + human visual checkpoint)
- Roadmap and state updated, phase marked complete
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Phase 13: Results Page Transformation — not started (needs /gsd:plan-phase 13)
- Phase 14: Input & Settings Page Elevation — not started
- After Phase 14: v1.2 milestone complete
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Global :focus-visible in @layer base replaces three per-component outline:none + box-shadow patterns
- border: 1px solid transparent on .verdict-badge base for layout stability before JS applies verdict class
- .btn-ghost uses var(--border-default) — 10% opacity white border for visibility
- var(--bg-tertiary) zinc-800 for .form-input vs var(--bg-primary) for .ioc-textarea — depth hierarchy on card surfaces
- rgba(9,9,11,0.85) hardcoded in filter bar — alpha required for backdrop-filter, can't use CSS custom property
- -webkit-backdrop-filter included for Safari 15.x compatibility
- Heroicons v2 SVGs embedded in Jinja2 macro — avoids CDN, enables CSS currentColor inheritance
- brand-accent wraps only "Sentinel" — minimal markup for emerald accent
- Tagline changed to "IOC Triage Tool" — reflects dual online/offline capability
- .site-logo font changed from var(--font-mono) to var(--font-ui) — brand in Inter Variable
- .btn-ghost tree-shaken from dist/style.css (expected — no template references it yet, Phase 13/14 will fix)
- @tailwindcss/forms .form-input:focus blue ring coexists — address in Phase 14 when templates apply the class
</decisions_made>

v1.2 Modern UI Redesign is a frontend-only milestone (zero backend changes). Phase 11 laid the foundation (fonts, design tokens, WCAG verification). Phase 12 elevated all shared components (badges, buttons, focus rings, form inputs, filter bar, icons, header/footer). Phase 13 will transform the results page — the most complex page with IOC cards, enrichment slots, verdict dashboard, and filter bar interactions. Phase 14 finishes with input page and settings page elevation.

All 224 tests passing. The component CSS is solid — Phase 13 can build on it without worrying about design system primitives.
