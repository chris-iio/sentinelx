# Phase 3.1: Integration Fixes and Git Hygiene - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-22
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Close all integration gaps identified by the v1.0 milestone audit: fix CSP regression from inline script, commit untracked shared module, clean working directory, and reconcile stale documentation. No new features — this restores compliance and cleans up tech debt.

## Implementation Decisions

### Documentation scope
- Fix BOTH ROADMAP.md checkboxes AND Phase 3 SUMMARY.md inaccuracies — full doc reconciliation
- ROADMAP.md: only fix the 6 audit-flagged checkboxes (Phase 2: 02-02/03/04, Phase 3: 03-01/02/03) — not a full audit of all phases
- SUMMARY.md: targeted fix only — correct the "per-adapter helper copies" wording to reflect the shared `http_safety.py` module. Do NOT review other factual claims in summaries
- Milestone audit report (`.planning/v1.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`): update resolved items to reflect current status after fixes are applied — do not leave as historical snapshot

### Claude's Discretion
- Commit organization (atomic per fix vs grouped)
- Script migration approach (how to structure `initSettingsPage()` in `main.js`)
- Testing strategy for the JS migration
- Order of operations for the fixes

## Specific Ideas

No specific requirements — open to standard approaches. The milestone audit report provides exact file locations and suggested fixes for each integration issue.
