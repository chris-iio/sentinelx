<current_state>
Phase 11 is fully planned (3 plans, 3 sequential waves, verified by plan-checker).
No execution has started. The phase is ready to execute. GSD was updated to v1.21.0
this session and health repair regenerated STATE.md.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- v1.1 phase directories archived to `.planning/milestones/v1.1-phases/` (cleanup)
- Phase 11 research: Complete (11-RESEARCH.md)
- Phase 11 planning: Complete (11-01-PLAN.md, 11-02-PLAN.md, 11-03-PLAN.md)
- Plan verification passed with 1 advisory (FOUND-07 theme extension intentionally deferred)
- Knight helmet logo: Added to header + favicon (commit a3e11fb, outside phase scope)
- GSD update: v1.20.6 → v1.21.0 (global install, local patch backed up for core.cjs)
- GSD health repair: STATE.md regenerated, 3 W002 stale phase reference warnings fixed
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Execute Plan 11-01 (Wave 1): Download fonts, add @font-face, update base.html with preload + color-scheme meta, configure tailwind.config.js
- Execute Plan 11-02 (Wave 2): Rewrite :root token block to zinc/emerald/teal, migrate all component rules to new tokens, add autofill override CSS
- Execute Plan 11-03 (Wave 3): Run automated WCAG AA contrast audit, human visual verification checkpoint
- Run `make css` after each wave to rebuild dist/style.css
- Run pytest after Plans 01 and 02 to catch regressions
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Sequential waves required: Plans 01 and 02 both modify input.css
- Verdict token strategy: Remove old single-name tokens entirely, replace with triples (text/bg/border) atomically
- IOC type accent colors: Kept as-is pending contrast audit in Plan 03
- FOUND-07 partial scope: Tailwind theme extension for colors intentionally omitted — all colors consumed via var() in @layer components
- No template structural changes in this phase — only base.html gets preload links and meta tag
- Logo uses hardcoded fill #e6edf3 (not currentColor) — img tags can't inherit CSS color
- Header alignment changed from baseline to center for img element compatibility
- GSD local patch backed up: get-shit-done/bin/lib/core.cjs (reapply with /gsd:reapply-patches)
</decisions_made>

SentinelX is a SOC analyst IOC triage tool. v1.1 shipped with reduced scope.
v1.2 "Modern UI Redesign" is the active milestone with 4 phases (11-14).
Phase 11 lays the foundation: typography, design tokens, base component CSS.
The key gate is WCAG AA contrast verification in Plan 03 — must pass before
component work begins in Phase 12.

STATE.md was regenerated by health repair and shows milestone as v1.0 — this is
stale from the repair tool's roadmap parsing. The actual active milestone is v1.2.

Font files (Inter Variable ~70KB, JetBrains Mono Variable ~60KB) need to be
downloaded and self-hosted — no CDN allowed due to CSP and offline deployment.
