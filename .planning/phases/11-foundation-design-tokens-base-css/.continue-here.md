<current_state>
Phase 11 is fully planned with 3 plans in 3 sequential waves, verified by plan-checker. No execution has started. The phase is ready to execute.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- v1.1 phase directories archived to `.planning/milestones/v1.1-phases/` (cleanup)
- Phase 11 directory created: `.planning/phases/11-foundation-design-tokens-base-css/`
- 11-RESEARCH.md written — covers token migration strategy, font URLs, verdict triple pitfall, contrast audit approach
- 11-01-PLAN.md (Wave 1) — Font infrastructure + base.html dark-mode + Tailwind config (FOUND-02, FOUND-03, FOUND-04, FOUND-07, FOUND-08)
- 11-02-PLAN.md (Wave 2) — Design token rewrite + component rule migration + autofill override (FOUND-01, FOUND-06, FOUND-08)
- 11-03-PLAN.md (Wave 3) — WCAG AA contrast verification + human visual checkpoint (FOUND-05)
- Plan verification passed with 1 advisory (FOUND-07 theme extension intentionally deferred per architecture decision)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Execute Plan 11-01 (Wave 1): Download fonts, add @font-face, update base.html with preload + color-scheme meta, configure tailwind.config.js
- Execute Plan 11-02 (Wave 2): Rewrite :root token block to zinc/emerald/teal, migrate all component rules to new tokens, add autofill override CSS
- Execute Plan 11-03 (Wave 3): Run automated WCAG AA contrast audit, human visual verification checkpoint
- Run `make css` after each wave to rebuild dist/style.css
- Run pytest after Plans 01 and 02 to catch regressions
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Skipped discuss-phase: Phase 11 requirements and research are comprehensive enough — no meaningful gray areas for user input
- Sequential waves (not parallel): Plans 01 and 02 both modify input.css, so they must run in order
- Verdict token strategy: Remove old single-name tokens entirely, replace with triples (text/bg/border) atomically
- IOC type accent colors: Kept as-is pending contrast audit in Plan 03
- FOUND-07 partial scope: Tailwind theme extension for colors intentionally omitted — all colors consumed via var() in @layer components, not via utility classes in templates
- No template structural changes in this phase — only base.html gets preload links and meta tag
</decisions_made>

- None — ready to execute

<context>
This is the first phase of v1.2 Modern UI Redesign (frontend-only milestone). Phase 11 establishes the foundation that all subsequent phases (12-14) depend on. The key gate is WCAG AA contrast verification — must pass before any component work begins in Phase 12. The existing CSS uses a GitHub blue-gray palette that gets replaced with zinc/emerald/teal. Font files (Inter Variable ~70KB, JetBrains Mono Variable ~60KB) need to be downloaded and self-hosted — no CDN allowed due to CSP and offline deployment scenarios.
